                <p>The Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM), unofficially termed as Mangalyaan, was a space probe orbiting Mars since 24 September 2014. It was launched on 5 November 2013 by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). It was India's first interplanetary mission and it made ISRO the fourth space agency to achieve Mars orbit. It made India the first Asian nation to reach the Martian orbit and the first nation in the world to do so on its maiden attempt</p>

                <p>The Mars Orbiter Mission probe lifted off from the First Launch Pad at Satish Dhawan Space, Andhra Pradesh, using a Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) rocket C25 at 09:08 UTC on 5 November 2013. The launch window was approximately 20 days long and started on 28 October 2013. The MOM probe spent about a month in Earth orbit, where it made a series of seven apogee-raising orbital manoeuvres before trans-Mars injection on 30 November 2013 (UTC). After a 298-day transit to Mars, it was put into Mars orbit on 24 September 2014.</p>
                <br><p>Assembly of the PSLV-XL launch vehicle, designated C25, started on 5 August 2013. The mounting of the five scientific instruments was completed at Indian Space Research Organisation Satellite Centre, Bengaluru, and the finished spacecraft was shipped to Sriharikota on 2 October 2013 for integration to the PSLV-XL launch vehicle. The satellite's development was fast-tracked and completed in a record 15 months, partly due to using reconfigured Chandrayaan-2 orbiter bus.</p>

                    <li style="padding: 2px;"><span style="font-weight: bolder;">Bus: </span>The spacecraft's bus is a modified I-1 K structure and propulsion hardware configuration, similar to Chandrayaan-1, India's lunar orbiter, with specific improvements and upgrades needed for a Mars mission. The satellite structure is constructed of an aluminium and composite fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP) sandwich construction.</li>
                    <li style="padding: 2px;"><span style="font-weight: bolder;">Power: </span>Electric power is generated by three solar array panels of 1.8 m × 1.4 m each (7.56 m<sup>2</sup> total), for a maximum of 840 watts of power generation in Mars orbit. Electricity is stored in a 36 Ah Lithium-ion battery.</li>
                    <li style="padding: 2px;"><span style="font-weight: bolder;">Propulsion: </span>A liquid fuel engine with a thrust of 440 newtons is used for orbit raising and insertion into Mars orbit. The orbiter also has eight 22-newton thrusters for attitude control. Its propellant mass at launch was 852 kg (1,878 lb).</li>
                    <li style="padding: 2px;"><span style="font-weight: bolder;">Attitude and Orbit Control System: </span>Maneuvering system that includes electronics with a MAR31750 processor, two-star sensors, a solar panel Sun sensor, a coarse analog Sun sensor, four reaction wheels, and the primary propulsion system.</li>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 5px; text-align: left;">The scientific objectives deal with the following major aspects:</p>
                    <ul style="font-size: 25px;">
                        <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exploration of Mars surface features by studying the morphology, topography and mineralogy</li>
                        <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Study the constituents of Martian atmosphere including methane and CO2 using remote sensing techniques</li>
                        <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Study the dynamics of the upper atmosphere of Mars, effects of solar wind and radiation and the escape of volatiles to outer space</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p style="margin-top: 5px;">
                        The mission would also provide multiple opportunities to observe the Martian moon Phobos and also offer an opportunity to identify and re-estimate the orbits of asteroids seen during the Martian Transfer Trajectory.
                        In May–June 2015 Indian scientists got an opportunity to study the Solar Corona during the Mars conjunction when earth and Mars are on the opposite sides of the sun. During this period the S band waves emitted by MOM were transmitted through the Solar Corona that extends millions of kms into space. This event helped scientists study the Solar surface and regions where temperature changed abruptly.

                    <p>The total cost of the mission was approximately ₹450 Crore (US$73 million), making it the least-expensive Mars mission to date. The low cost of the mission was ascribed by ISRO chairman K. Radhakrishnan to various factors, including a "modular approach", few ground tests, and long working days (18 to 20 hours) for scientists. BBC's Jonathan Amos specified lower worker costs, home-grown technologies, simpler design, and a significantly less complicated payload than NASA's MAVEN.</p>
